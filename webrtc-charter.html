    <h1 id="title">[DRAFT] Web Real-Time Communications Working Group Charter</h1>

    <p><em>This is a draft for an updated W3C WebRTC Working Group charter; it has no formal standing. See also the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc-charter.html">current WebRTC Working Group charter</a>.</em></p>

    <p class="mission">The
    <strong>mission</strong> of the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group, part of
    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/uwa/Activity.html">Ubiquitous Web Applications Activity</a>, is to define client-side APIs to enable Real-Time Communications in Web browsers.</p>

    <p>These APIs should enable building applications that can be run inside a browser, requiring no extra downloads or plugins, that allow communication between parties using audio, video and supplementary real-time communication, without having to use intervening servers (unless needed for firewall traversal, or for providing intermediary services). APIs enabling supplementary functions, such as recording, image capture and screen sharing are also in scope.</p>

    <div class="scope">
      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

	<p>Enabling real-time communications between Web browsers require the following client-side technologies to be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>API functions to explore device capabilities, e.g. camera, microphone, speakers,</li>
<li>API functions to capture media from local devices (e.g. camera and microphone, but also output devices such as a screen),</li>
<li>API functions for encoding and other processing of those media streams,</li>
<li>API functions for establishing direct peer-to-peer connections, including firewall/NAT traversal</li>
<li>API functions for decoding and processing (including echo cancelling, stream synchronization and a number of other functions) of those streams at the incoming end,</li>
<li>Delivery to the user of those media streams via local screens and audio output devices (partially covered with HTML5)</li>
</ul>

	  <h3>Success Criteria</h3>

	  <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected to have two independent implementations of each feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, interoperability between the independent implementations (that is, bidirectional audio and video communication between the implementations) should be demonstrated.</p>

      <div>
	<h3>Out of Scope</h3>
	<p>The definition of the network protocols used to establish the connections between peers is out of scope for this group; in general, it is expected that protocols considerations will be handled in the IETF.</p>
	<p>The definition of any new codecs for audio and video is out of scope.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

	  <h3>Recommendation-Track Deliverables</h3>
<p>The working group will deliver specifications that cover at least the following functions, unless they are found to be fully specified within other working groups' finished results:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Media Stream Functions</dt>
<dd>API functions to manipulate media streams for interactive real-time communications, connecting various processing functions to each other, and to media devices and network connections, including media manipulation functions for e.g. allowing to synchronize streams. Supplementary functions such as recording of media streams are also in scope.</dd>
<dt>Audio Stream Functions</dt>
<dd>An extension of the Media Stream Functions to process audio streams, to enable features such as automatic gain control, mute functions and echo cancellation.</dd>
<dt>Video Stream Functions</dt>
<dd>An extension of the Media Stream Functions to process video streams, to enable features such as bandwidth limiting, image manipulation or "video mute".</dd>
<dt>Functional Component Functions</dt>
<dd>API functions that allow to query for the components present in an implementation, instantiate them, and connect them to media streams.</dd>
<dt>P2P Connection Functions</dt>
<dd>API functions to provide interfaces that enable the conveyance of parameters necessary to establish peer to peer connections, based on the protocols selected by the IETF RTCWeb Working Group. Included in this category are also API functions to allow identification of the peer.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The working group may decide to group the specified functions in one or more specifications. The Working Group has already started and will continue work on the following specifications:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/">WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers</a></dt>
<dd>JavaScript APIs to allow media and data to be sent to and received from another browser or device implementing the appropriate set of real-time protocols</dd>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/webrtc-stats.html">Identifiers for WebRTC's Statistics API</a></dt>
<dd>JavaScript APIs that allow access to statistical information about a peer-to-peer connection established via the WebRTC API</dd>
</dl>
<p>as well as on the following specifications jointly developed with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/">Device APIs Working Group</a>:</p>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html">Media Capture and Streams</a></dt>
<dd>JavaScript APIs that allow local media, including audio and video, to be requested from a platform</dd>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-record/MediaRecorder.html">MediaStream Recording</a></dt>
<dd>a JavaScript API to record MediaStreams</dd>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-image/">MediaStream Image Capture</A></dt>
<dd>a JavaScript API to capture still images from a video MediaStream</dd>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-depth/">Media Capture Depth Stream Extensions</a></dt>
<dd>An extension to the Media Capture and Streams API to capture depth streams (e.g. from 3D cameras)</dd>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-fromelement/">Media Capture from DOM Elements</a></dt>
<dd>An extension to DOM elements to allow to capture a media stream from their content</dd>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-output/">Audio Output Devices API</a></dt>
<dd>JavaScript APIs that let a Web application manage how audio is rendered on the user audio output devices</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-screen-share">Screen Capture API</a></dt>
<dd>An extension to the Media Capture and Streams API to use a user's display, or parts thereof, as the source of a MediaStream.</dd>
</dl>


<p>This work will be done in collaboration with the IETF. The W3C will define APIs to ensure that application developers can control the components or the architecture for selection and profiling of the wire protocols that will be produced by the IETF Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) Working Group. While the specified API Functions will not constrain implementations into supporting a specific profile, they will be compatible with the Profile that will be specified by the RTCWeb Working Group.</p>

<p>As the name implies, <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/">WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers</a> is to be considered as a first version of APIs for real-time communication. The working group will, once <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/">WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers</a> reaches Candidate Recommendation, consider working on a new set of low level object-oriented APIs for real-time communication. The activities in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/ortc/">ORTC (Object Real-time Communications) Community Group</a> indicate that there is interest in a new set of APIs. As part of this consideration, the group will reevaluate its deliverables and milestones, and may reconsider its scope.</p>

<p>The specified API Functions and the requirements on their implementation must offer functionality that ensures that users' expectations of privacy and control over their devices are met - this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that users can control what local  devices an application can access for capturing media, and are able to at any time revoke that access.</p>

<p>Similarly, all the deliverables must address issues of security - this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that arbitrary UDP packets cannot be sent to arbitrary destinations and ports. The security and privacy goals and requirements will be developed in coordination with the IETF RTCWeb Working Group.</p>

<p>Similarly, all deliverables must address issues of accessibility
including relevant requirements listed in the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/pfwg/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media User Accessibility
Requirements document (MAUR)</a>, such as multiple well-synchronized
instances of the same media type. The accessibility goals and requirements
will be developed in coordination with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a>.</p>

	  <div id="ig-other-deliverables">
	    <h3>Other Deliverables</h3>
	    <p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency, and implementability, and to promote interoperability between User Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test suite, which should be completed by the end of the Last Call phase, and must be completed, with an implementation report, before transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation. Additional tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a implementation report is encouraged. </p>
<p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primers</li>
<li>Requirements and use case document for specifications.</li>
<li>Non-normative group notes</li>
</ul>
<p>Given sufficient resources, this Working Group should review other working groups' deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working Group's mission. </p>

      <p>To be successful, the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its
      duration. Effective participation to Web Real-Time Communications Working Group is expected to consume one work day per week for each
      participant; two days per week for
      editors. The Web Real-Time Communications Working Group will
      allocate also the necessary resources for building Test
      Suites for each specification.</p>

      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.</p>
