      <h1 id="title">[DRAFT] Web Real-Time Communications Working Group Charter</h1>

      <p><em>This is draft revised charter for the W3C WebRTC Working Group for discussion in the Working Group. It has no formal standing.</em></p>

      <p class="mission">The
    <strong>mission</strong> of the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group is to define client-side APIs to enable Real-Time Communications in Web browsers.</p>

      <p>These APIs should enable building applications that can be run inside a browser, requiring no extra downloads or plugins, that allow communication between parties using audio, video and supplementary real-time communication, without having to use intervening servers (unless needed for firewall traversal or for providing intermediary services). APIs enabling supplementary functions, such as recording, image capture, and screen sharing are also in scope.</p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
	<p>Enabling real-time communications between Web browsers requires the following client-side technologies to be available:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>API functions for transferring data between peers, and</li>
          <li>API functions for establishing direct peer-to-peer connections, including firewall/NAT traversal.</li>
        </ul>
        The working group will address issues related to using these functions
        in various contexts on the Web platform, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Traditional Web pages,</li>
          <li>Web Workers of various types,</li>
          <li>Iframes, with appropriate access controls, and</li>
          <li>Applications that span multiple pages.</li>
          <li>
            Pages, workers and frames specifying content security policies
            or other security mechanisms that should impact the use of these
            APIs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Working Group will deliver specifications that cover the following functions until another group becomes available to take that work over:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>API functions to explore device capabilities, e.g. camera, microphone, speakers,</li>
          <li>API functions to capture media from local devices (e.g. camera and microphone, but also output devices such as a screen),</li>
          <li>API functions for encoding and other processing of those media streams,</li>
          <li>API functions for accessing the data in these media streams,</li>

          <li>API functions for decoding and processing (including echo canceling, stream synchronization, and a number of other functions) of those streams at the incoming end, and</li>
          <li>Delivery to the user of those media streams via local screens and audio output devices (partially covered with HTML5).</li>

        </ul>

        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
          <p>The definition of the network protocols used to establish the connections between peers is out of scope.  In general, it is expected that protocol considerations will be handled in the IETF.</p>
	  <p>The definition of any new codecs for audio and video is out of scope.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="success-criteria">
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
	  <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification is expected to have two independent implementations of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, interoperability between the independent implementations
            (that is, bidirectional audio and video communication as well as data transfer between the implementations) should be demonstrated.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>

          <p>The Working Group will deliver specifications that cover at least the following functions, unless they are found to be fully specified within other Working Groups' finished results:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Data Access Functions</dt>
            <dd>API functions that allow Web applications to access and manipulate data in media streams.</dd>
            <dt>Data Transfer Functions</dt>
            <dd>API functions to provide interfaces that enable the transfer of data between peers, 
              Included in this category are API functions for message-based as well as stream-based communications. This also includes integrating changes that would be required to support implementations of <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-t140-usage-data-channel'>T.140 Real-Time Text over WebRTC</a> in browsers
              <br>The WG will consider any necessary API changes or extensions to enable use of more than one data transfer protocol to support the data transfer functions.</dd>
            <dt>P2P Connection Functions</dt>
            <dd>API functions to provide interfaces that enable the conveyance of parameters necessary to establish peer to peer connections, based on the protocols selected by the IETF RTCWeb Working Group. Included in this category are also API functions to allow identification of the peer.</dd>
            <dt>Network Management Functions</dt>
            <dd>API functions to provide control on network traffic characteristics such as congestion control, bandwidth limitation, or latency.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>The Working Group will deliver specifications that cover the following functions until another group becomes available to take that work over:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Media Stream Functions</dt>
            <dd>API functions to manipulate media streams for interactive real-time communications, connecting various processing functions to each other, and to media devices and network connections, including media manipulation functions for e.g. allowing to synchronize streams. Supplementary functions such as recording of media streams are also in scope.</dd>
            <dt>Audio Stream Functions</dt>
            <dd>An extension of the Media Stream Functions to process audio streams, to enable features such as automatic gain control, mute functions and echo cancellation.</dd>
            <dt>Video Stream Functions</dt>
            <dd>An extension of the Media Stream Functions to process video streams, to enable features such as backpressure control, image manipulation or "video mute".</dd>
            <dt>Functional Component Functions</dt>
            <dd>API functions that allow to query for the components present in an implementation, instantiate them, and connect them to media streams.</dd>
            <dt>Data Access Functions</dt>
            <dd>API functions that allow Web applications to access and manipulate data in media streams.</dd>
          </dl>
          
          <p>The Working Group may decide to group the specified functions in one or more specifications, and to develop extensions to its existing specifications to bring additional functionality identified as needed.</p>

          <p>The Working Group has already started and will continue work on the following specifications: </p>

</ul>
	  <p>The Working Group intends to re-publish the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">WebRTC API</a> as an updated Recommendation based on collected errata and new features.</p>

	  
<p>The preferred mode of adding new features is by means of extension specifications, rather than new features in the existing specs. At appropriate times, the WG may choose to redistribute the work between chartered documents - by splitting, merging or repartitioning the work as appropriate.</p>

<p>This work is done in collaboration with the IETF. The W3C defines APIs to ensure that application developers can control the components of the architecture for selection and profiling of the wire protocols that have been produced by the IETF Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) Working Group. While the specified API Functions will not constrain implementations into supporting a specific profile, they will be compatible with the Profile that is specified by the RTCWeb Working Group.</p>

<p>In addition to the work items identified above, the Working Group will consider developing further extensions to the WebRTC 1.0 core API. In developing these new APIs, the Working Group will adhere to the following principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct control: The new APIs are intended to provide direct control over the details of real-time communication, where the application can directly specify how information should be transmitted, without any built-in negotiation semantics.</li>
<li>Standalone operation: The new APIs will be complete enough to allow applications to write solely to the new APIs to complete common tasks.</li>
<li>Backwards-compatibility: The new APIs will extend the WebRTC 1.0 APIs, rather than replace them. Applications that use the PeerConnection API will continue to function, unless there is a clear and compelling reason to deprecate specific 1.0 functionality.</li>
<li>Feature independence: Features may be introduced in the new APIs that are not available when using the PeerConnection API.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-nv-use-cases/">use-case document</a> is maintained to identify the functionality that needs new API for realization.</p>

<p>The specified API Functions and the requirements on their implementation must offer functionality that ensures that users' expectations of privacy and control over their devices are met - this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that users can control what local  devices an application can access for capturing media, and are able to at any time revoke that access.</p>

<p>Similarly, all the deliverables must address issues of security. The security and privacy goals and requirements will be harmonized with those developed by the IETF RTCWeb Working Group.</p>

<p>Similarly, all deliverables must address issues of accessibility
including relevant requirements listed in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/apa/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media User Accessibility
Requirements document (MAUR)</a>, such as multiple well-synchronized
instances of the same media type. The accessibility goals and requirements
will be developed in coordination with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a>.</p>

        <div id="ig-other-deliverables">
          <h3>
            Other Deliverables
          </h3>
	  <p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency, and implementability, and to promote interoperability between User Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test suite, which must be completed, with an implementation report, before transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation. Additional tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a implementation report is encouraged. </p>

          <p>In particular, since WebRTC deals with communications, specific attention will be brought to the interoperability testing of the WebRTC API implementations (both browser-to-browser and browser-to-native).</p>

          <p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Primers</li>
            <li>Requirements and use case document for specifications</li>
            <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Given sufficient resources, this Working Group should review other Working Groups' deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working Group's mission. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="timeline">
          <h3>Timeline</h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webrtc/">group's home page</a> provides current data about all of the group's specifications. Although the group expects all of its active deliverables to progress during this charter period, the charter does not include detailed milestone data for each specification because such data is speculative and easily becomes out of date. The Working Group does expect the following to occur:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Media Capture and Streams: Recommendation in Q1 2023</li>
            <li>Identifiers for WebRTC Statistics: Recommendation in Q1 2023</li>

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months before <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webrtc/">WebRTC Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most WebRTC Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work in its repositories' GitHub issues and on its public mailing list <a href="mailto:public-webrtc@w3.org">public-webrtc@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webrtc/" title="Public archives of the WebRTC mailing-list">archives</a>).

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>After mailing list and other informal discussion, substantive change proposals should be submitted as GitHub pull requests.  These can come from the editors or from WG members.</p>
        <p>Chairs are responsible for determining whether or not there is WG consensus for the changes contained in a pull request.
      <p>Editors are responsible for âcuratingâ the pull requests to reject frivolous ones and substantive ones that the Chairs have determined do not comply with the IPR policies.</p>
      <p>In cases where the editors make substantive changes without WG consensus, those changes must be labeled as provisional. The chairs are responsible for resolving the status of such changes.</p>

        <p>
          When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
